Do you care about climate change? Do you want to make a contribution to the nature based solutions while staying behind your computer? Moja global participates in a variety of mentoring programs. Our open source projects are a great way to spend your time and learn new skills along with contributing to our community projects.

We are a non-profit collaboration of volunteers and students from all over the world, under the Linux Foundation. Our flagship software is Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT), a tool that is used to estimate emissions and sinks of greenhouse gasses from forestry and agriculture. You can know more about moja global on [official website](https://moja.global) and the [community website](https://community.moja.global/).
