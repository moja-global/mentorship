# Google Summer of Code 2020 Ideas

**NOTE**: moja global is participating in the Google Summer of Code 2020 and successful project have been announced.

Students can indicate their interest in working with moja global by just sending an email to [info@moja.global](mailto:info@moja.global) or going through the [Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) Open Source Center (OSC) ideas page](https://hub.osc.dial.community/t/google-summer-of-code-2020-open-source-center/1025).

The DIAL Open Source Center is moja global's “umbrella organization” to GSoC. This will help raise awareness about moja global's proposed projects among student applicants. The [moja global projects can be found on the DIAL website](https://hub.osc.dial.community/t/gsoc-2020-ideas-moja-global/1024).

The DIAL Open Source Center (OSC) is a collective group of people and open source projects working together to build co-investment in shared resources that benefit each other.

We are proposing three types of projects but the scope of these projects is large enough for many students.

* Developing New Models/Modules for FLINT
* Refactor FLINT Core Code Base
* Develop FLINT User Interface
