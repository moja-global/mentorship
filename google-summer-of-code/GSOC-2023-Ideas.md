## About moja global

Help fight climate change from your keyboard! [Moja global](https://moja.global) provides tools for estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gasses (GHG) from the land sector. The [Full Lands INtegration Tool](https://github.com/moja-global/flint), also known as FLINT, available under MPL-2.0 License, is a platform developed by the moja global team for data collection, analysis, and continuous improvement of greenhouse gas inventories related to land use and land-use change at local, national and global scales.

The FLINT is based on over 20 years of experience building and operating measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) tools in Australia and Canada. The FLINT provides the capability to quickly establish an operational MRV system responding to policymaking and planning needs. The FLINT has been designed to achieve the required accuracy through step-by-step improvements.

New FLINT users are expected to follow the IPCC guidelines to develop increasingly accurate and robust systems for greenhouse gas accounting. Users are supported by moja global, a vibrant developer community, and philanthropic partners like the UNFCCC and IUCN. We aim to grow our institutional users and require excellent communication, education, and documentation across various topics, including science, policy, and software development.

Moja global has hosted mentees from [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs), [The Linux Foundation](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) and [Outreachy internships](https://outreachy.org/). The Mentorship Working Group can put interested applicants in contact with previous mentees and mentors as needed. We aim to be an inclusive community and hold regular meet-ups for moja global's Working Groups. Enthusiasm, generosity, and creativity are celebrated and encourage people to join our community to collaborate for change.

Prospective developers should have a look at the [Google Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and the [Google Summer of Code Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/) to learn more about the program. To draft a proposal, use the [Google Summer of Code proposal template](GSOC-STUDENT-TEMPLATE.md) proposed by our community.
