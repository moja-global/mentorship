# Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. Google may provide students with stipends at Google's sole discretion. In general the stipends are adjusted to cost of living. More info can be found on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/).

## Moja global & Google Summer of Code

Students can indicate their interest in working with moja global by just sending an email to [info@moja.global](mailto:info@moja.global). Students still have to write up a project proposal for the summer and submit it to Google. If accepted, students will spend a month getting to know moja global prior to the start of coding. Students then have three months to code, meeting the deadlines agreed upon with their mentors.

- [GSoC 2020 Ideas List](GSOC-2020-Ideas.md)

## Application Process

Moja global puts up the ideas list early so we can define them together. We want to work with potential student developers BEFORE GSoC starts. So get in touch. Check out the [eligibility criteria](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/) and the [application process](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/).

Here are the steps and some tips on getting started:

1. Think of a good idea â€“ For reference from last year see our previous year's idea lists and selected projects.
2. Do some research yourself based on the idea, write up a proposal draft.
3. Create an issue on this repository with the proposal draft and share it on the relevant channel on Slack workspace.
4. Based on feedback, write a full proposal and submit it to Google Summer of Code website.
5. If accepted, you will be working with a mentor as a student developer.
