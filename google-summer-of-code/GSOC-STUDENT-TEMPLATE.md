# Moja global project proposal template for GSoC

## Tips to write a good proposal

- Study the [Student guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
- Understand the timeline, application process and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
- Start as early as possible; Make first contacts with the mentors before starting to fill in the proposal and make sure to discuss your project idea.
- Share the first draft of your proposal as early as possible; Do not copy-paste from the official project description.
- Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
- Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline and after all the reviews have been done.
