# Google Season of Docs 2021 Project

The goal of this project is to develop a content strategy that makes our different documentation types easy to navigate, access and understand. In addition to the core FLINT library, our community has developed a small ecosystem of interrelated tools and platforms. As our community has grown, so has our documentation, some of which remains siloed or inaccessible to end-users and developers who would like to work with us.

## Problem

Right now, new users experience difficulty understanding how moja global projects can be used or are interrelated. Last year, our GSoD efforts led to the development of a website to onboard new contributors, a ReadTheDocs environment for our technical documentation, and completed documentation for the moja global Reporting Tool. We’d now like to extend these resources and by adding easy to follow examples of how the FLINT works and can be used with other tools to our documentation and contributors websites.

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Standardize documentation across all of our repositories and improve navigation between moja global projects
- Promote user documentation on how to conduct and configure FLINT using the JSON configuration application.
- Migrate our control flow and architecture diagrams to our contributor’s site making it accessible to a wide audience
- Create a list of available FLINT modules for users to customise their land use change models.
- Publish a tutorial on how to post-process the FLINT results using the moja global Visualisation and Reporting tools.

In order to facilitate a higher volume of documentation and communications, we also propose to develop a system for publishing case studies in addition to our technical documentation. We would like to add markdown documents to our contributors website for thematic discussions that appeal to a wide range of audiences.

### Technical writer `#1` - Harsh Bardhan Mishra

Harsh is a Computer Science and Engineering student from Chennai, India. Harsh will work with mentors Sabita Rao (technical writer by profession and GSoD '20 participant), Sagar Utekar (MTS2 at VMWare, GSoD and GSoC mentor) and the moja global Technical Steering Committee (TSC) to canvas existing FLINT users, including the Mullion Group (Australia) and NRCan (Canada). Harsh will develop excellent technical communication skills and experience obtaining expert advice to create an intuitive and approachable content. During GSoD he will work closely with the TSC to develop a content strategy for case studies and news that can be incorporated into the contributors website.

Harsh will be expected to:

-   Develop a content strategy for moja global:
	- Audit the user experience when navigating moja global projects and documentation.
	 - Develop a style guide for moja global for a consistent documentation.
	 - Design overarching content workflow that ensures regular content creation, review and promotion.

-   Prepare documentation on setting up configuration files:
	 - Audit the existing documentation and regarding FLINT configuration as this is currently fragmented and difficult to navigate.
	 - Connect with subject matter experts and developers to understand the most common FLINT analyses
	 - Provide a beginner friendly tutorial for two (2) analyses (Tier-1 and Tier-3) being actively developed by moja global teams.

-   Develop case studies for moja global:
	 - Work with the TSC to prioritise a list of case studies.
	 - Collaborate with volunteers within the Documentation Working Group to develop five (5) case studies for moja global.
	- Publish two (2) case studies on the contributors website.


### Technical writer `#2` - Sarthak Kundra

Sarthak Kundra will work with mentors Sneha Mishra (contributors website developer, ReadTheDocs maintainer, and GSoD 2020 graduate!) and Dr. Andrew O’Reilly-Nugent (TSC Director) to organise our technical and developer documentation. This will involve collaboration with the Documentation Working Group, moja global brand management partners at Climate Advisors, and the maintainers of moja global projects. Sarthak has keen eye for detail and great instincts for designing a pain-free documentation experience. Sarthak's web development experience will enabled Sarthak to take the lead on the provisioning of a static site generator, with support from other moja global developers.

-   Update the existing contributors website:
	- Work with our UI/UX and communications experts to add content and improve navigation.
	 - Use a static site generator to render markdown content and add this to the contributors websites.
	 - Document the process for adding content to the contributors website.

-   Design a documentation architecture for improved navigation between projects and their documentation
	 - Audit moja global projects repositories and associated documentation to assess conformance with the moja global style guide.
	 - Transcribe the control flow and system architecture diagrams from LucidChart to a Web Component.
	 - Design and visualize a map of moja global repositories and services.

-   Plan a migration of existing documentation onto our ReadTheDocs platform:
	 - Update the moja global [ReadTheDocs](https://github.com/moja-global/moja_global_docs) README and provide common instructions for submitting documentation.
	 - Publish the content strategy and contribution workflows for new documentation on ReadTheDocs.
	- Coordinate the migration of existing documentation for the FLINT, Reporting Tool, Taswari, GBCM and JSON application onto ReadTheDocs.

### Volunteers:

-   Mohammad Warid, to help develop a user-experience (UX) plan and provide support with web development contributions.
-   Shubham Karande, to assist with systems documentation, mapping the existing moja global repositories and unearthing the technical aspects of FLINT.
-   Mohit Kumar, to work with Technical Writer `#1` on developing case studies with the FLINT and providing inputs for the end user documentation.
