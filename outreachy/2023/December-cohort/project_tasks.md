# Outreachy December 2023 Contribution Phase

Welcome to the Outreachy December 2023 contribution phase at [Moja Global](https://moja.global/). We are very excited to have you participate in our community during this second phase of the selection process of the Outreachy program. Collaboration, transparency and peer encouragement is highly required in the Moja global slack community. We have compiled a list of beginner friendly tasks to help you in this phase of your application. Endeavor to follow the instructions as stated and don't forget to record your contribution after the completion of each task. Happy Contributing:)

# Task 0- Git & Github
Git and Github play a central role in maintaining open-source projects. This encourages transparency, collabortion and accessibility.
* Create a[ github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) if you don't have one yet.
* Add a new repository called Outreachy_username_2022. Where username = your slack handle on [moja global slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw)
* Clone this repository to your local computer using [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To facilitate your work, you can use a code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

# Task 1- Land sector management and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The [Land sector dataset repository](https://github.com/moja-global/Land_Sector_Datasets) is bringing together datasets that can be useful for land sector management. The metafiles are located in the repository whereas the the data library is located on [moja global hosted google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PZCVksHsuNyPzB9QTyraBSs1C7_c7W56). You can draw inspiration from this [issue](https://github.com/moja-global/Handbook/issues/8) in the Handbook.

* Select a given country/region/province/state/city (preferably your local environment).
* Navigate the data library to find all types of data corresponding to your selected area.
* Create a jupyter notebook in your repository and carryout data analysis on the corrsponding data you found in the data library.(Use graphs, plots, dataframes etc to provide visualization and interpretation of the data).
* Sign off commits and push your work, raise a pull request, record your contribution and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the slack community.

# Task 2- Attribute-SDG Mapping Prototype
* Fork and clone the [Land sector repository](https://github.com/moja-global/Land_Sector_Datasets) to your computer.
* Navigate the data library and select a dataset of your choice. Associate the dataset with it's metafile in the cloned repo.
* Choose two relevant SDGs identified in the research task. Develop a prototype for mapping specific attributes from the dataset to these [SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).
* Sign off commits and push your work, raise a pull request, record your contribution and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the slack community. Note: exclude the data file from the commit.

# Task 3- Geospatial Analysis
* If the dataset contains spatial information, perform geospatial analysis to identify patterns or trends.
* Use GeoPandas and other geospatial libraries in Python and provide visualizations (maps) and a brief report on any spatial patterns or correlations discovered.
* Sign off commits and push your work, raise a pull request, record your contribution and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the slack community. Note: exclude the data file from the commit.
# Task 4- Visualization Prototype
* Develop a prototype for the data visualization component. 
* Create visualizations that represent the mapped relationships between land attributes and SDGs  making available the python code for the prototype visualizations.
* Sign off commits and push your work, raise a pull request, record your contribution and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the slack community. Note: exclude the data file from the commit.

# Task 5- User Documentation
* Begin drafting the user documentation, focusing on the basics of interpreting the integrated data and using the visualization tool.
* Sign off commits and push your work, raise a pull request, record your contribution and share the link in the #outreachy channel of the slack community.

### Conclusion
The criteria for selection for the final phase are irrepective of the completion of the stated tasks, but rather based on qualities clearly defined on the Outreachy website. If you have completed the tasks and want to add your contributions, please feel free to repeat Tasks 2, 3 & 4 for different datasets in the data library.
