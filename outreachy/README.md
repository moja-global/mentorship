# Outreachy Internships

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. Outreachy provides 3-month internships to work on open source software projects on both coding and non-coding projects, e.g, marketing, documentation, testing, etc. OSC-affiliated projects that are participating in Outreachy during this mid-year term are pleased to accept the following internships:

## Application process

Before applying to Outreachy, you should first go through the [eligibility criteria](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#eligibility) thoroughly. The first step in the application process is the initial application. In the initial application, you have to provide your basic information, your time commitment, and 4 [essay questions](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#initial-application). After a result release, successful candidates would work with the interest organizations during the contribution period. A final application/proposal should be drafted and reviewed, before you put up a final application on the Outreachy website.
