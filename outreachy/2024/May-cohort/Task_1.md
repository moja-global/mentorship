# Outreachy May 2024 Contribution Phase- Week 1

Welcome to the Outreachy May 2024 contribution phase at [Moja Global](https://moja.global/). We are very excited to have you participate in our community 
during this second phase of the selection process of the Outreachy program. Collaboration, transparency and peer encouragement is highly required in the 
Moja global slack community. We have compiled a list of beginner friendly tasks spread across weeks to help you in this phase of your application. 
Endeavor to follow the instructions as stated and don't forget to record your contribution after the completion of each task. Happy Contributing:)

## Project 1: Developing a FLINT Forest Monitoring tool using Land Sector datasets

Please introduce yourself in `#18-uutreachy` - we'd love to know where you come from and what you're interested in. Then proceed to the [FLINT Handbook](https://moja-global.github.io/Handbook/). If you'd like to install FLINT please review the instructions at [docs.moja.global](https://docs.moja.global) and as for help in `#05-installation-support`. We have some demonstration guides in the FLINTcloud and GCBM.Belize that you can follow to better understand the types of models we plan on using. 

Once comfortable, please study the existing FLINTcloud templates and the Land Sector Datasets repository. Find an appropriate forest dataset and propose a location of interest (pick a forest you like!). Find another datasets of interest and document a workflow to extract and summarise forest squares in your location. Then share your findings on the `#18-outreachy` channel.

## Project 2: Packaging FLINT for cross-platform usage 
Study the FLINT and follow our [FLINT Developer tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_WECUlMWiUkyx5ohT2jglPSa58XmOhgY) and 
[FLINT Development setup docs](https://docs.moja.global/en/master/FLINT/FLINTDevelopmentSetup/index.html) to get started. Formulate a release process 
plan and share your findings on the `#18-outreachy` channel.

## Project 3: Develop pipeline for high-throughput visualisation on Google Earth Engine

Study the GCBM tutorials on our Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQd8VDrgFRk) to get started. Propose an example algorithm 
that summarises a geospatial time series and describes its time and memory complexity on the `#18-outreachy` channel.
