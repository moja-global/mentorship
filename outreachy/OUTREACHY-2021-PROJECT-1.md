# Outreachy 2021 Project - 021 December to 2022 March round

Land plays an important role in global cycles of greenhouse gases (GHG). Land use activities result in emissions and removals of GHG to the atmosphere. The Fifth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for almost a quarter (~10–12 Gt CO2eq/yr) of anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from activities such as deforestation, forest degradation and also from livestock, soil, nutrient management and agricultural burning.

Moja global's Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) has been developed to support the GHG inventories development and the implementation of mitigation actions in the AFOLU sector. But, some functions and features of the FLINT need to be refined or added in order to fully support mitigation actions and establishment and maintenance of sustainable GHG inventory management systems in developing countries. The UNFCCC secretariat has initiated a collaboration with moja global to refine the FLINT and make it available to developing countries across all regions.

This project focuses on the development of FLINT module to account for the dynamics of carbon from forest living biomass into dead organic matter pools (DOM). A DOM module simulates annual changes in the C stocks of each pool that occur due to growth, biomass turnover, litterfall, transfer and decomposition as well as complex disturbances that can alter biomass turnover, and transfers between DOM pools (litter, dead wood and soil).

You will work with moja global ecosystem modelling experts to identify candidate models for describing DOM dynamics in forestry, collect data and parameter calibrations to test and evaluate the DOM module. We need candidates with great communication skills in writing, project documentation and data management. You will be working as part of a team to document our project. You will develop expertise in climate change research, data analysis and team collaboration.

Skills in Python, R or C++ are desirable and any code developed under this project will be open source to facilitate GHG models by experts around the world. We are focusing on Latin America, and Spanish speaking candidates are encouraged to apply!
